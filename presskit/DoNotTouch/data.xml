      <text>In the first version of DNT, the concept was really simple : just place the button on a flat surface and touch it, and .. something happen. And the kids loved it. 
      Do Not Touch has even won its first Clio Entertainment Award for the category Virtual/Augmented Reality in 2018.</text>
