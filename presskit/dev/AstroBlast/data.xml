  <description>
  AstroBlast is the fruit of a collaboration with Honey Poney Games, in which we tried to extract the pleasure of micro-managing units in RTS games, with the more immediate and explosive fun of a Shmup.  
  Travel from planet to planet to wipe out the alien threat and grow your squad of space Marines!
  Every type of marine has their own unique strengths and weaknesses, from the well-rounded Gunner, to the feisty Flamer!
  Customize your squad to create the ultimate alien blasting team of intergalactic mercenaries!

      <text>
      The story of AstroBlast began with a prototype created by David C of Honey Poney Games, a top-down 2D concept reminiscent of old Starcraft mods, but streamlined into a frantic shooter.
      He showed it off to Flat Pixel one night over some beers, and we couldn’t stop playing!
      Something about the game just felt right, and we decided to collaborate with Honey Poney to expand the game to discover its full potential.

      We worked on the game feverishly between projects, and eventually released a first version on the App Store called Blastarts! After a few weeks on the store we were contacted by Space Ape, who loved the game and wanted to learn a bit about our team.
      They invited us to their swanky London studio and we chatted about potential next steps.
      We decided to finish the game on our own to see how far we could get.

      A few months later we were showing off the newly renamed and overhauled AstroBlast! at Games First London jointly hosted by Supercell and Space Ape.
      The reaction was very positive, testers had a hard time putting it down!

      <head>Almost there!</head>
      <text>
      But of course, the game still wasn’t finished!
      A long few months of client work kept us from diving back into AstroBlast, and it stayed on the back burner throughout the summer and autumn.. until now! 
      We’re happy to share that AstroBlast is back in production! And we’re doing everything we can for an early 2020 release!
      So hold on to your butts amigos!
