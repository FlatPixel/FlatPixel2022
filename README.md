### Flat Pixel Website
This website is **handmade** with simple stack (no package manager) so only HTML5, sass, css and javascript. The Sass file is compiled directly in VSCode with the *Live Sass Compiler* extension. You can also use the VSCode Extension *Live server* to launch a local environment. <br>
The presskit pages (company & projects) are included in sub folders.

### PressKit
The Press Kit page is done with the presskit tool from https://github.com/pixelnest/presskit.html. 

*You should install presskit on your machine from npm package manager.*
